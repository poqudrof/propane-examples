### Installing libraries ###
For libraries other than `sound` and `video` eg `pdf` you need to copy the library folder to `~/.propane/libraries` (_ie just like the installer does for video and sound_). Same is true for external libraries like `hype` (renaming to lower case as required eg `~/.propane/libraries/hype/library/hype.jar`).

Interestingly the `pdf` library from processing-2.2.1 seems to work just fine with `propane-1.2.2`.
