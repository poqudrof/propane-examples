# propane-examples
Example Sketches for propane see also [Example-Sketches][examples] for ruby-processing (many of with only need to be class wrapped to run with propane).

1. Sketches using the [data_path wrapper][path] (yields absolute path to `data` folder). NB without wrapper these sketches would need to be run using jruby-complete (`propane --run sketch.rb` rather than `jruby sketch.rb`

2. Other [sketches][regular], can be run with `propane --run sketch.rb` or `jruby sketch.rb`
